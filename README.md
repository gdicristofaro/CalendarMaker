# CalendarMaker
Makes a powerpoint version of a yearly calendar.  

This site makes use of a modified version of [PptxGenJS](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS) for powerpoint generation as well as modified portions of [moment-holiday](https://github.com/kodie/moment-holiday) for holiday parsing and calculation.

Live example can be found [here](https://gdicristofaro.github.io/CalendarMaker/).
